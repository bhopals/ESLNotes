Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to register a case about a bag that I lost on the train on 15th April while travelling from Toronto to Vancouver.
The item that I lost is a black leather bag , and it has a unique Toronto Raptors sticker on the top side of it. I was in coach number 10th of the Train no. 58RT. My bag contains a laptop, some important documents, and medical essentials in it.
While leaving the train, hastily, I forgot to pick my hand bag as I was busy moving my other bags. By the time I realized that my small bag was missing, the train had already left the station. I tried calling the customer service to inform them about the incident, but did not get any help from them.
I would appreciate it if you check with your lost and found department and see if they found any bag that matches with the description given above.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,
Bhopal Singh
