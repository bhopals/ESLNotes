### Subject-Verb Agreement - Numerical Phrases

- BASIC Rule - A SINGULAR SUBJECT takes a SINGULAR VERB, whereas a PLURAL SUBJECT takes a PLURAL VERB

  - EXCEPTION to Basic Rule
    - The first-person pronoun takes a Singular Verb (I go, I drive).
    - The Basic form of the verb is used after certain main verbs (Plural form - without s/es) such as watch, see, hear, feel, help, let, and make.
      ( He watched Ronaldo score the winning goal)

- RULE 1 - A Subject will come before a phrase beginning with `of`. The `of` is the culprit in many, perhapds most,
  subject-verb mistakes.

  - Example
    - INCORRECT - `A bouquet` of yellow roses `lend`...
    - CORRECT - `A bouquet` of yellow roses `lends`...

- RULE 2 - Two singular subjects connected by `or`, `either/or`, or `neither/nor` require a single verb.

  - Example
    - My aunt `or` uncle `is` arriving by train today.

- RULE 3 - The verb in `or`, `either/or`, or `neither/nor` sentence agrees with the noun or pronoun closest to it.

  - Example

    - Neither `the plate`s nor `the service bowl` `goes` on that shelf.
    - Neither `the serving bowl` nor `the plates` `go` on that shelf.

  - This rule can lead to bumps in the road or awkward sentence (Even though grammatically correct)
    For example - if `I` is one of the subject of two (or more) subjects, it could lead to this odd sentence:
    AWKWARD - Neither `she`, `my friends`, nor `I` `am` going to the festial.
    CORRECT - Neither `she`, `I`, nor `my friends` `are` going to the festial.
    CORRECT - `She`, `my friends`, and `I` `are` going to the festial.

- RULE 4 - As a general rule, use plural verb with two or more subjects when they are connected by `and`

  - Example - A Car `and` a bike `are` my means of transportation
  - Exceptions
    - Use Singular in COMPOUND NOUNS (Two Nouns - Combination of (NOUN+NOUN), (ADJECTIVE+NOUN), (PREPOSTION+NOUN))
    - `Breaking and entering` `is` against the law.
    - The `Bed and breakfast` `was` charming.
  - NOTE - Some think it is incorrect to place a pronoun (I, He, She...) first in a multi-subject sentence.
    - Example
      - `I`,` my dad`, and `my step-mom` `are` going to the movies.
      - `She` and `Orvile` `bought` a dog.
    - While not grammatically incorrect per se, it is a courtsey to place the pronoun last, except when awkward to do so
      - `my step-mom`,` my dad`, and `I` `are` going to the movies.
      - `Orvile` and `She` `bought` a dog.

- RULE 5a - Sometimes the subject is separated from the verb by such words as long with, as well as, besides, not, etc.
  These words and phrases are not part of the subject. Ignore them and use a singular verb when the subject is singular.

  - Example
    - `The politician`, along with the newsmen, `is` expected shortly.
    - `Excitement`, as well as nervousness, `is` the cause of her shaking.

- RULE 5b - Parentheses are not part of the subject.

  - Example
    - `Joe` (and his trusty mutt) `was` always welcome.
  - If this seems awkward, try rewriting the sentence.
    - `Joe` and `his trusty mutt` `were` always welcome.

- RULE 6 - In sentences beginning with `here` or `there`, the true subject `follows the verb`.

  - Examples

    - There `are` four `hurdles` to jump.
    - There `is` a high `hurdle` to jump.
    - Here `are` the `keys`.

  - Note
    - The word there's a contraction of there is, leads to bad habits in informal sentences like
      `There's a lot of people here today`, because it's easier to say "there's" than "there are".Take care never
      to use There's with a Plural subject. So it should be - `There are a lot of people here today`.

- RULE 7 - Use a singular verb with distances, periods of time, sums of money, etc, when considered as a unit.

  - Example
    - `Three miles` `is` too far to walk.
    - `Ten dollars` `is` a hight price to pay.
    - `Five years` `is` the maximum sentence for that offence.
  - BUT
    - `Ten dollars` (i.e. dollar bills (chillars)) `were` scattered on the floor.

- RULE 8a - With words that indicate portions - e.g. `a lot`, `a majority`, `some`, `all` -
  Rule 1 given earlier in this section is reversed, and we are guided by the nound after `of`.
  If the noun after of is singular, use a singular verb.
  If the noun after of is plural, use a plural verb.

  - Example

    - Some of the pies are missing.
    - Some of the pie is missing.

  - NOTE
    - `none` can be singular and plural.
      If the context seems singular, use singular.  
      If the context seems plural, use plural.
      none of us = Plural

- RULE 8b - With COLLECTIVE NOUNS such as
  `group`, `jury`, `family`, `audience`, `population`, the verb might be singular or plural, depending on the writers intention.

  - Example

    - My family has arrived.
    - My family have arrived.
    - All of my family have arrived.
    - A third of the population was not in favor.
    - A third of the population were not in favor.

  - NOTE
    - Anyone who uses a plural verb with a collective noun must take care to be accurate - and also consistent.
    - It must not be done carelessly.
    - Example (Both are correct - Just be consistent)
      - `The staff` `is` deciding how `it` `wants` to vote.
      - `The staff` `are` deciding how `they` `want` to vote.
      - `The staff members` `are` deciding how `they` `want` to vote.

- RULE 9 - The word `were` replaces was in sentences that express a wish or are contrary to fact. Subjunctive Mood.
  It is used to express a hypothetical, wishful, imaginary, or factually contradicatory thought.

  - We use subjunctive mood - WISHES, SUGGESTION, DESIRE....
    The Subjuctive mood is one of the three moods in English Grammar. The subjunctive mood is for exoressing
    wishes, suggestions, or desires, and is usually indicated by a verb such as wish or suggest.

  - Example
    - I wish `it` `were` Friday.
    - She requested that `he` `raise` his hand.
    - The foreman demanded that `joe` `wear` safety googles.

# 11/APRIL/2022 (MONDAY) - Complete Sentence - Part 1

- Incomplete sentence is called Sentence Fragment (Missing `Subject` or `Verb`, or BOTH (`Subject` + `Verb`)).
- Complete Sentence - SUBJECT + VERB and IT MUST EXPRESS A COMPLETE IDEA (An Independent clause).
  - `Joe` `left` his coffee.
- Sentence Fragment - no VERB + no Subject
  - in the afternoon after the end of the difficult French Examination
- Sentence Fragment - Only VERB + no Subject
  - `Spilled` her drink all over the new white rug
- Sentence Fragment - Only Subject + no Verb

  - `The man` with the tattoo of two snakes

- Examples

  - Joe left his coffee cup on top of the car. (COMPLETE SENTENCE)
  - Spilled her drink all over the new white rug. (SENTENCE FRAGMENT)
  - The man with the tattoo of two snakes. (SENTENCE FRAGMENT)
  - in the afternoon after the end of the difficult French examination. (SENTENCE FRAGMENT)
  - The pilot chewed her fingernails during the terrible storm. (COMPLETE SENTENCE)

- Incomplete Ideas - The Sentence Fragment

  - Sometimes a clause has a Subject and a Verb, but it is still not a complete sentence
    because it does not present a complete idea. Let's take a look at these examples

    - Carlo loves
    - Wan Bo is buying
    - The teacher explained.

  - In these three examples, we have subjects and verbs, but we need objects to make complete sentences.
    What (or Whom) does Carlo love? What is Bo Buying? What did the teacher explained?
    We must add more information in order to make a complete sentence.

    - Carlo loves cold pizza
    - Wan Bo is buying a new wig
    - The teacher explained the answer.

  - A Subject and verb taken together form a clause. When a clause forms a complete idea and can
    stand by itself, it is called an Independent clause.
  - In order to form a complete sentence, there must be at least one independent clause.

- CLAUSES BEGINNING WITH SUBORDINATING CONJUNCTIONS - DEPENDENT CLAUSES

  - A dependent clause has a subject and a verb. However, it begins with a subordinating conjunction,
    so it cannot stand alone. It is not a complete sentence.

    `Barbara wrote a long paragraph` - This is an independent caluse and a complete sentense.

    `After Barbara wrote a long paragraph` - The addition of conjunction after changes
    the clause from INDEPENDENT to DEPENDENT. We are waiting for more information at the end,
    so it is incomplete. In order to make it complete sentence, we must add an INDEPENDENT CLAUSE.

    `After Barbara wrote a long paragraph, she went for a walk` - Now we have a complete sentence.

    - Examples (Complete Sentence)
      - If you love me, you will let my mother stay with us for a month.
      - Because it is raining, we cannot have a picnic.
      - When we saw her ex-boyfriend, Carol became angry.
      - Although Wiemer has a lot of money, he does not have any friends.
      - Ms. Witherspoon sold the house after her father died.
      - Yao studied extra vocabulary because he wanted to get a good grade.

- Transitive Verbs v/s Intransitive Verbs

  - A Verb can be described a transitive or intransitive based on whether it requires an object to
    express a complete thought or not. A TRANSITIVE verb is one that only makes sense if it exists
    on an object. An INTRANSITIVE verb will make senset without any object. Some verbs may be used both ways.

  - Transitive Verbs

    - Transitive verbs are not just verbs that can take an object; they demand objects. Without an object to affect,
      the sentence that a transitive verb inhabits will not seem complete.
    - Example
      - The girls carry water to their village.
      - Juan threw the ball.
      - Could you phone the neighbors?
      - I caught a cold.
      - She loves rainbows.
      - Lila conveyed the message.

  - Intransitive verbs
    - An intransitive verb is the opposite of a transitive verb: It does not require an object to act upon.
    - Example
      - They jumped.
      - The dog ran.
      - She sang.
      - A light was shining.

- Clauses Beginning with Subordinating Conjunctions - Dependent Clauses
  `C` - Complete Sentence / `F` (Fragment - no subject, no verb, dependent clause, incolplete idea )

1. Nestor shaved his bread - (C => Subject + Trans. Verb + Object)
2. When I see her - (F - Dependent Clause started with Coordinating Conj.)
3. Loves to read in the kitchen - (F - No Subject)
4. Macey looks to look out of the Window. - (C)
5. If you really need my help - (F - Dependent Clause)
6. The nurse helped the sick doctor - (C)
7. The incrediblly large scar on his nose - (F - No verb)
8. Is a beautiful day - (F - Incomplete idea)
9. The dog barked all night along - (C)
10. Because the sun is so hot - (F - Dependent Clause)
11. Every day, go to work early - (F - No Subject)
