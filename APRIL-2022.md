### Subject-Verb Agreement - Numerical Phrases

- BASIC Rule - A SINGULAR SUBJECT takes a SINGULAR VERB, whereas a PLURAL SUBJECT takes a PLURAL VERB

  - EXCEPTION to Basic Rule
    - The first-person pronoun takes a Singular Verb (I go, I drive).
    - The Basic form of the verb is used after certain main verbs (Plural form - without s/es) such as watch, see, hear, feel, help, let, and make.
      ( He watched Ronaldo score the winning goal)

- RULE 1 - A Subject will come before a phrase beginning with `of`. The `of` is the culprit in many, perhapds most,
  subject-verb mistakes.

  - Example
    - INCORRECT - `A bouquet` of yellow roses `lend`...
    - CORRECT - `A bouquet` of yellow roses `lends`...

- RULE 2 - Two singular subjects connected by `or`, `either/or`, or `neither/nor` require a single verb.

  - Example
    - My aunt `or` uncle `is` arriving by train today.

- RULE 3 - The verb in `or`, `either/or`, or `neither/nor` sentence agrees with the noun or pronoun closest to it.

  - Example

    - Neither `the plate`s nor `the service bowl` `goes` on that shelf.
    - Neither `the serving bowl` nor `the plates` `go` on that shelf.

  - This rule can lead to bumps in the road or awkward sentence (Even though grammatically correct)
    For example - if `I` is one of the subject of two (or more) subjects, it could lead to this odd sentence:
    AWKWARD - Neither `she`, `my friends`, nor `I` `am` going to the festial.
    CORRECT - Neither `she`, `I`, nor `my friends` `are` going to the festial.
    CORRECT - `She`, `my friends`, and `I` `are` going to the festial.

- RULE 4 - As a general rule, use plural verb with two or more subjects when they are connected by `and`

  - Example - A Car `and` a bike `are` my means of transportation
  - Exceptions
    - Use Singular in COMPOUND NOUNS (Two Nouns - Combination of (NOUN+NOUN), (ADJECTIVE+NOUN), (PREPOSTION+NOUN))
    - `Breaking and entering` `is` against the law.
    - The `Bed and breakfast` `was` charming.
  - NOTE - Some think it is incorrect to place a pronoun (I, He, She...) first in a multi-subject sentence.
    - Example
      - `I`,` my dad`, and `my step-mom` `are` going to the movies.
      - `She` and `Orvile` `bought` a dog.
    - While not grammatically incorrect per se, it is a courtsey to place the pronoun last, except when awkward to do so
      - `my step-mom`,` my dad`, and `I` `are` going to the movies.
      - `Orvile` and `She` `bought` a dog.

- RULE 5a - Sometimes the subject is separated from the verb by such words as long with, as well as, besides, not, etc.
  These words and phrases are not part of the subject. Ignore them and use a singular verb when the subject is singular.

  - Example
    - `The politician`, along with the newsmen, `is` expected shortly.
    - `Excitement`, as well as nervousness, `is` the cause of her shaking.

- RULE 5b - Parentheses are not part of the subject.

  - Example
    - `Joe` (and his trusty mutt) `was` always welcome.
  - If this seems awkward, try rewriting the sentence.
    - `Joe` and `his trusty mutt` `were` always welcome.

- RULE 6 - In sentences beginning with `here` or `there`, the true subject `follows the verb`.

  - Examples

    - There `are` four `hurdles` to jump.
    - There `is` a high `hurdle` to jump.
    - Here `are` the `keys`.

  - Note
    - The word there's a contraction of there is, leads to bad habits in informal sentences like
      `There's a lot of people here today`, because it's easier to say "there's" than "there are".Take care never
      to use There's with a Plural subject. So it should be - `There are a lot of people here today`.

- RULE 7 - Use a singular verb with distances, periods of time, sums of money, etc, when considered as a unit.

  - Example
    - `Three miles` `is` too far to walk.
    - `Ten dollars` `is` a hight price to pay.
    - `Five years` `is` the maximum sentence for that offence.
  - BUT
    - `Ten dollars` (i.e. dollar bills (chillars)) `were` scattered on the floor.

- RULE 8a - With words that indicate portions - e.g. `a lot`, `a majority`, `some`, `all` -
  Rule 1 given earlier in this section is reversed, and we are guided by the nound after `of`.
  If the noun after of is singular, use a singular verb.
  If the noun after of is plural, use a plural verb.

  - Example

    - Some of the pies are missing.
    - Some of the pie is missing.

  - NOTE
    - `none` can be singular and plural.
      If the context seems singular, use singular.  
      If the context seems plural, use plural.
      none of us = Plural

- RULE 8b - With COLLECTIVE NOUNS such as
  `group`, `jury`, `family`, `audience`, `population`, the verb might be singular or plural, depending on the writers intention.

  - Example

    - My family has arrived.
    - My family have arrived.
    - All of my family have arrived.
    - A third of the population was not in favor.
    - A third of the population were not in favor.

  - NOTE
    - Anyone who uses a plural verb with a collective noun must take care to be accurate - and also consistent.
    - It must not be done carelessly.
    - Example (Both are correct - Just be consistent)
      - `The staff` `is` deciding how `it` `wants` to vote.
      - `The staff` `are` deciding how `they` `want` to vote.
      - `The staff members` `are` deciding how `they` `want` to vote.

- RULE 9 - The word `were` replaces was in sentences that express a wish or are contrary to fact. Subjunctive Mood.
  It is used to express a hypothetical, wishful, imaginary, or factually contradicatory thought.

  - We use subjunctive mood - WISHES, SUGGESTION, DESIRE....
    The Subjuctive mood is one of the three moods in English Grammar. The subjunctive mood is for exoressing
    wishes, suggestions, or desires, and is usually indicated by a verb such as wish or suggest.

  - Example
    - I wish `it` `were` Friday.
    - She requested that `he` `raise` his hand.
    - The foreman demanded that `joe` `wear` safety googles.
